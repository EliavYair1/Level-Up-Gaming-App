# Level-up gaming

MERN stack project
online gaming store

# Important note!:

In the back-end there is a config folder which holds json web token key
Because this is a student project I uploaded it.
I wanted to give the full website experience and I know this is a bad practice under normal circumstances

# run commands (in terminal):

• Cd {project directory} npm I {install node modules for each folder}

• Back-end {initial} npm run dev (node)

• Front-end {initial} npm start (react)

# Description:

• My first full-stack project using React JS and Node.JS with MongoDB

• CRUD (Crate – user, Read-user info, UPDATE – update user info, DELETE – delete user)

• Redux state management – connect the project to redux store reducer

• Persistent cart using local storage ( saves users cart data in the local storage )
